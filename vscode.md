To install Visual Studio Code (VSCode) on FreeBSD, you can follow these steps:

1. **Update Ports Collection:**
   Make sure your ports collection is up to date:
   ```sh
   sudo portsnap fetch update
   ```

2. **Install VSCode:**
   Use the `ports` system to install VSCode. The port for VSCode is `editors/vscode`:
   ```sh
   cd /usr/ports/editors/vscode
   sudo make install clean
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   VSCode requires some additional dependencies. Ensure they are installed:
   ```sh
   sudo pkg install -y git libx11 libxkbcommon
   ```

4. **Run VSCode:**
   After installation, you can start VSCode by running:
   ```sh
   code
   ```

If you prefer to use the binary release instead of ports:

1. **Download the Binary:**
   Go to the [VSCode download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and download the `.tar.gz` file for FreeBSD.

2. **Extract the Archive:**
   Extract the downloaded archive:
   ```sh
   tar -xzf <path-to-downloaded-file>.tar.gz -C /usr/local/
   ```

3. **Create a Symlink:**
   Create a symlink to make it easier to run VSCode:
   ```sh
   sudo ln -s /usr/local/VSCode-linux-x64/code /usr/local/bin/code
   ```

4. **Run VSCode:**
   Launch VSCode using:
   ```sh
   code
   ```
